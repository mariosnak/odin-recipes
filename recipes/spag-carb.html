  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Spaghetti alla Carbonara is a classic Roman pasta dish made with pancetta, eggs, Parmesan, Pecorino, and black pepper. 
    No creamâ€”just a rich, creamy sauce created from the emulsification of pasta water and egg-cheese mixture.
    Simple, fast, and incredibly flavorful, this dish is comfort food at its finest.
  </p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>100g pancetta</li>
    <li>50g Pecorino cheese</li>
    <li>50g Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>350g spaghetti</li>
    <li>2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole</li>
    <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
    <li>Sea salt, to taste</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
    <li>Finely chop the pancetta (remove rind), grate both cheeses, and mix them together.</li>
    <li>Beat the eggs in a bowl and season with black pepper. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Add 1 tsp salt to boiling water. Cook the spaghetti for about 10 minutes or until al dente.</li>
    <li>Bruise the garlic cloves with the side of a knife.</li>
    <li>While pasta cooks, melt butter in a large pan and fry pancetta with garlic for ~5 minutes until golden and crisp. Discard garlic.</li>
    <li>Keep pancetta on low heat. Use tongs to transfer cooked spaghetti into the pancetta pan. Reserve pasta water.</li>
    <li>Mix most of the cheese into the beaten eggs, saving a small handful for garnish.</li>
    <li>Remove pan from heat. Quickly pour in egg-cheese mixture, and toss the pasta so it coats without scrambling.</li>
    <li>Add a few tablespoons of reserved pasta water to create a silky sauce. Season with salt if needed.</li>
    <li>Plate the pasta by twisting with a fork. Top with remaining cheese and a final grind of black pepper.</li>
    <li>If the dish dries out before serving, add a bit more hot pasta water to revive the sauce.</li>
  </ol>
